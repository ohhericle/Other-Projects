            UC Berkeley School of Information graduate student focusing on Data Science. I became interested in data science after recognizing the impact data has on our world. Whether we realize it or not, data is what drives our every data lives. From autonomous vehicles to routine hospital visits, data is used in almost every aspect of our lives. With so much data around the world, it is a shame not to use it to our advantage. My goal is to translate such data to real world applications to help change the world.

	    Prior to MIDS, my professional background consisted of being a System Engineer for a pharma manufacturing company. I was in charge of  managing all the controlled systems within the company and made sure all systems were FDA compliant. In addition to this, I work closely with executives, supervisors, project managers and third party clients to ensure products are manufactured and delivered on schedule.

	    As someone who suffered from mental health illness, I am extremely passionate about raising awareness about mental health and allocating the necessary resources to help treat mental illness in & out of the workplace. I am honored to have worked with amazing colleagues on this project that shared the same vision as me. We hope this project makes a positive impact in the mental health community.

            Many of my family members, including my aunt and sister, have studied different branches of psychology which has made mental health a big part of my life from a young age. I have witnessed my own family member's struggless with mental illness which has made me particularly passionate about continuing conversations around mental health and getting rid of the stigma behind mental illness. This project is one way in which I hope I can make a positive impact in the mental health community.

            Current UC Berkeley School of Information graduate student focusing on Data Science (MIDS). I became interested in pursuing data science 2 years ago when I experienced first hand the positive effects data literacy and making data driven decisions has at an organizational level. From that moment on, I delved deeper into the world of data science and realized its power goes beyond the corporate walls. It can be used to improve people's lives and is the key to modernizing our world for the better. 
          </p>

	My professional background is centered in the finance industry as I have been working at Vanguard for the past five years. Within the company I held various positions such as Personal Investor, Business Technology Admin, to my current role as a PR and Corporate Communications Data Analyst. As a Data Analyst my role consists of researching and implementing data analysis into day to day responsibilities through measurement of brand awareness and reputation. I also work very closely with senior leadership by helping them make data driven decisions that will have a direct impact on how our clients perceive our brand.
          </p>
          <p>
	I've been lucky enough to work for a company that cares about their employees well being and mental health, and advocates for a healthy work-life balance through many  means. However, I am aware that not all workplaces offer a safe space or resources to their employees to allow them to take care of their mental health and how employees can often suffer from a mental health issue without even realizing it or knowing how to get help. With this data, we are able to tell the story of how an individual's workplace can impact their mental health. I hope our work will urge organizations to take action to prioritize their employees' well-being, let those who are dealing with mental health issues know that they are not alone, and most importantly, help connect them to the right resources to get the care and support they need.

            UC Berkeley School of Information graduate student focusing on cybersecurity (MICS). I became interested in cybersecurity out of personal curiosity, recognizing the social and safety importance of it in our highly connected world of networked devices and machines that support modern society, and wanting to ensure that products which I help develop provide effective levels of safety and privacy. Recognizing the importance of data science as it applies to cybersecurity,  during the MICS program I’ve also studied research design, machine learning, and data visualization.

            My professional background includes test, development, and management engineering positions at IBM, Dell, Brocade, and Broadcom. The development of computer storage and networked systems has been a primary focus of my career. I’m currently a director of test engineering at Broadcom leading teams that are responsible for delivering high quality and secure networked storage solutions to leading companies and organizations across the globe.

            As a leader of teams and individual direct reports, I’ve recognized that my greatest and most important assets are my people. Physical equipment and resources are necessary; however, the knowledge and talent that people contribute are key to success. The requirements of their jobs can be stressful in combination with everything else that occurs in their lives. I’ve recognized that mental health awareness and access to resources that help promote high levels of  good mental health is important to being a successful leader in the tech industry.
