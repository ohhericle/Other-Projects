      <p>On June 27, 2015, the Lifestyle Boost 350 was made available through a worldwide release. The shoe was first released in a white and grey "Space Grey" color scheme. On August 22, 2015, an all-black version of the Lifestyle Boost 350 released, known as the "Black Hole." An olivine variant, the "Moonrock," was released exclusively to stores who were vendors for the Yeezy Season 1 clothing line. The fourth and final version of Season 1's 350 Boost was the "SandStorm," which featured a light-brown color scheme. In early 2016, a revised version of the Black Hole colorway was released. Revisions included additional support and padding to the heel. However, both iterations are relatively identical in appearance. All variants of the shoe retailed for $200.<img src="business images/yeezy1.jpg" alt="Lifestyle 350" width="250" height="150" align="top" vspace="19" hspace="19" class="img_float_left"/>
