		  <p><b>Shoe Size Selection Tips: To find the most comfortable footwear for you, consider buying shoes for both the width and the length of your feet. Some people need to purchase shoes that are narrow because they are never comfortable on wide one, or the opposite. You may even need to buy shoes that are especially slim or extra wide.
